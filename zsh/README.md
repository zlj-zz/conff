# My zsh

This is my zsh configuration. I like it every much, it's awesome.

And I use **zim** to manage my plug-ins. If you want to use this, you should put it in `~/.config/`

## [Install my zsh]

> You can check `zimrc.zsh` to see the all plug-ins I using.
> And you maybe need modify `env.zsh`

```shell
cd ~/.config/zsh

./plugins.zsh

zimfw install
```
